SMCode.exe is a component of Start Menu 8, a software developed by IObit that aims to restore the classic Start Menu in Windows operating systems, particularly for users transitioning from older versions of Windows. Generally considered safe when downloaded from the official publisher's website, it may, however, trigger false positive alerts from some antivirus programs due to its functionality and the nature of third-party applications. Users have reported encountering various errors related to SMCode.exe, including issues with installation and performance glitches that can arise during updates or system compatibility checks. It is important for users to ensure they are using the latest version of the software to mitigate potential problems and to verify the source of their download to avoid inadvertently installing malware disguised under the same filename.
